0.792 26.5.2004 timoe
---------------------
* The new version of the radix tree located in
  Src/FrameWork/RadixTree/RaxixTree.hh is ready for use.

0.776 26.4.2004 timoe
---------------------
* A new version of the radix tree implementation added to the repository.
  This version has some special features prepared for tvt.parallel and thus
  it consumes more memory than the common version. No iterator available.

0.752 24.1.2004 timoe
---------------------
* "Cosmetical" changes here and there. Happy New Year World and CHANGELOG!

0.745 28.10.2003 jaco
---------------------
* Fixed a bug in tvt.ag2tp.  It underallocated space for a BitVector.
  Not tested thoroughly enough but it should work for 99.9% of cases.

0.744 15.10.2003 timoe
---------------------
* Added files of the development version of the tvt.compiler to the
  Src/iLangCompiler directory. This version is not supposed to be
  stable at all times.

0.733 18.9.2003 timoe
---------------------
* Added support for extra information in transitions.

0.723 21.8.2003 warp
--------------------
* createswitch program added (still undocumented).
* Some bugs fixed (such as tvt.ag2lsts writing the header info
  Initially_unstable, which is acceptance graph info).

0.718 13.8.2003 timoe
---------------------
* ActionNamesStore operates in the "smart mode" for now on (no need to
  have a correct constructor's parameter anymore).

0.716 3.7.2003 jaco
-------------------

* Forgot to change "/dl-rej" & "/ll-rej" to "/dl_rej" & "/ll_rej" in
  Src/ag2tp/testall.  Fixed.

0.715 3.7.2003 jaco
-------------------

* Fixed a bug in Src/ag2tp/OutputLSTS.cc that labeled every state in the
  resulting tester process as a deadlock reject state.
* Renamed "/dl-rej" and "/ll-rej" in the output tester process to "/dl_rej"
  and "/ll_rej".

0.704 10.6.2003 warp
--------------------

* Added wildcard support for action name parameters in tvt.extendedrules
* Added 'hide' command to the State_prop_rules section
* New program: tvt.testerrules (still needs to be documented)

3.0.1
----- <May 20 2003>

 * An erroneus handling of livelock reject proposition in tvt.parallel
   fixed.
 * tvt.CFFDcompare script fixed.
 * A bug in handling header promises of LSTS files fixed.

0.670 20.5.2003 jaco
--------------------

* Fixed small error in instructions.tex (concerning tvt.ag2tp).

0.697 20.5.2003 jaco
--------------------

* Added the Src/ag2tp directory containing a tool to convert acceptance
  graphs to tester processes.  Updated various Makefiles to make the tool
  part of the system.

* Updated the documentation to describe the new tool.

* Fixed Makefile (tried to strip a shell script) and CHANGELOG.txt
  (important to couple changes with checkin version) that were broken in
  0.694 and 0.695.
